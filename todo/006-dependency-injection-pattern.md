# TODO: Dependency Injection Pattern

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Open

## Problem Description

The current codebase has tight coupling between modules, making it difficult to test components in isolation and swap implementations. Dependencies are created directly within modules, making the code hard to test and extend.

Current issues:
- Modules create their own dependencies directly
- Hard to mock dependencies for testing
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to swap implementations
- No clear dependency management

## Proposed Solution

Implement a dependency injection pattern using a context struct:

- Create a `ProcessingContext` struct that holds all dependencies
- Inject dependencies through the context rather than creating them directly
- Enable easy mocking and testing of components
- Provide a clean way to swap implementations

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Design the context structure
- Create `ProcessingContext` struct with all major dependencies
- Define interfaces for dependency injection
- Design the context initialization process
- Plan how to pass context through the system

### Step 2: Implement dependency injection
- Create `src/context.rs` with the context implementation
- Update modules to accept dependencies through context
- Implement context initialization with default implementations
- Add support for custom dependency implementations

### Step 3: Update existing code
- Update `generate.rs` to use dependency injection
- Update `template_processors` to use injected dependencies
- Update `converters` and `minifier` to use injected dependencies
- Ensure all tests work with the new system

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `ProcessingContext` is implemented and working
- [ ] All major modules use dependency injection
- [ ] Tests can easily mock dependencies
- [ ] Different implementations can be swapped easily
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Affected Components

- `src/context.rs` - New file with dependency injection context
- `src/generate.rs` - Update to use dependency injection
- `src/template_processors/` - Update to use injected dependencies
- `src/converters/` - Update to use injected dependencies
- `src/minifier/` - Update to use injected dependencies
- All test files - Update to use dependency injection

## Risks & Considerations

- **Breaking Changes**: Dependency injection may require significant refactoring
- **Complexity**: More complex initialization process
- **Performance**: Dependency injection may add slight overhead
- **Testing**: Need to ensure all tests work with new system

## Notes

Dependency injection will make the codebase much more testable and flexible. This is a significant architectural improvement that will enable better testing and easier extension.
