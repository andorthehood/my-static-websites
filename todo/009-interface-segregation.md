# TODO: Interface Segregation

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Open

## Problem Description

The current template processing system has a single large interface that handles multiple responsibilities. This violates the Interface Segregation Principle and makes the system harder to understand, test, and extend.

Current issues:
- Single large `process_template_tags` function handles multiple responsibilities
- Hard to test individual processing steps
- Difficult to add new processing types
- Complex function with many parameters
- Hard to understand what each part does

## Proposed Solution

Break down large interfaces into smaller, focused ones:

- Create separate traits for different processing responsibilities
- Implement focused interfaces for each processing step
- Make the system more modular and testable
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Analyze current processing steps
- Identify all the different processing responsibilities
- Map out the current processing pipeline
- Design focused interfaces for each responsibility
- Plan how to compose the interfaces

### Step 2: Create focused interfaces
- Create `ConditionalProcessor` trait for conditional processing
- Create `VariableProcessor` trait for variable processing
- Create `IncludeProcessor` trait for include processing
- Create `MarkdownProcessor` trait for markdown processing

### Step 3: Implement and integrate
- Implement each focused interface
- Create a composition system to combine processors
- Update existing code to use the new interfaces
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Large interfaces are broken down into focused ones
- [ ] Each interface has a single responsibility
- [ ] Processing steps can be tested independently
- [ ] New processing types can be easily added
- [ ] System is more modular and understandable

## Affected Components

- `src/traits.rs` - Add focused interface traits
- `src/template_processors/` - Implement focused interfaces
- `src/template_processors/processor.rs` - Refactor to use focused interfaces
- `src/template_processors/liquid/` - Update to implement focused interfaces
- `src/template_processors/markdown/` - Update to implement focused interfaces

## Risks & Considerations

- **Breaking Changes**: Interface changes may break existing code
- **Complexity**: More interfaces may increase complexity initially
- **Performance**: Multiple interface calls may add overhead
- **Testing**: Need to test all interface combinations

## Notes

Interface segregation will make the template processing system much more modular and easier to understand. This is a significant architectural improvement that will enable better testing and easier extension.
