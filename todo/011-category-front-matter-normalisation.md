# TODO: Category Front Matter Normalisation

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Open
**Completed**: N/A

## Problem Description

Many posts declare a `category` or `categories` field in their front matter, but the values are inconsistent. Some posts expose arrays, some use placeholder values like `post`/`posts`, and others mix legacy keys. This prevents downstream features from relying on the metadata because the semantics are unclear and forces templates to handle multiple shapes. To ship reliable category-based navigation, we need a single, meaningful category value or nothing at all.

## Proposed Solution

- Edit every post listed below so its front matter exposes at most one meaningful `category` value: trim whitespace, collapse arrays to the first non-empty value, and normalise casing while you update the file.
- Remove generic placeholder values (e.g., `post`, `posts`) entirely so posts without a meaningful category simply omit the field.
- Record any posts that lost their category during clean-up so follow-up editorial decisions can be made (e.g., notes in commit message or a tracking doc).
- Optionally add a lightweight check (script or documentation snippet) that future posts should avoid array syntax or placeholder categories.

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Finalise inventory and heuristics
- Review the lists below and confirm the handling for edge cases (arrays, placeholders, empty strings).
- Expected outcome: Signed-off rules for normalisation and removal.
- Dependencies or prerequisites: None.

### Step 2: Update post front matter
- Apply the agreed-upon normalisation rules to each post file, ensuring the `category` field is either a single meaningful string or removed.
- Expected outcome: Repository content embeds the normalised category metadata.
- Dependencies or prerequisites: Step 1 alignment on heuristics.

### Step 3: Document outcomes
- Capture which posts had categories removed or changed (commit message, changelog, or editorial note) so stakeholders can review.
- Expected outcome: Clear audit trail of the edits and any open follow-ups for content owners.
- Dependencies or prerequisites: Step 2 complete.

### Step 4: Add guardrails for new content
- Update documentation or content guidelines, and optionally add a simple lint script, so new posts follow the single-category rule.
- Expected outcome: Future posts ship with compliant front matter without relying on code-side fixes.
- Dependencies or prerequisites: Steps 1-3 define the desired behaviour.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All posts define at most one meaningful `category` value (or none) in their front matter.
- [ ] Placeholder categories (`post`/`posts`) are removed from the repository.
- [ ] Guidance or tooling exists to prevent reintroducing arrays or placeholders in new posts.

## Affected Components

- `sites/*/posts/*.md` - Manually normalise the front matter values.
- Documentation / contributor guidelines - Clarify the single-category rule.

## Risks & Considerations

- **Risk**: Manual edits may introduce front matter typos; mitigate with careful review or scripted validation.
- **Risk**: Removing placeholder values might hide posts from category listings until meaningful categories are added; track affected files for editorial follow-up.
- **Dependencies**: Blocks pagination work tracked in `todo/012-category-pagination-pages.md`.
- **Breaking Changes**: None expected in code, but content diffs should be reviewed closely.

## Related Items

- **Blocks**: `todo/012-category-pagination-pages.md`
- **Depends on**: None.
- **Related**: Existing front matter parsing tests and pagination logic.

## References

- Site content under `sites/*/posts` demonstrating current `categories` usage.
- Existing pagination generator that will consume the normalised categories.

## Notes

- Consider running a one-off script to verify no `categories:` arrays remain after edits.
- Once normalisation is in place, we can consider schema validation for front matter to prevent regressions.

## Posts with `categories` Front Matter

These posts currently declare a `categories` field and should be validated during normalisation:
