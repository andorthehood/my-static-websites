# TODO: Builder Pattern for Complex Operations

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Open

## Problem Description

The current generation process in `src/generate.rs` is complex and hard to configure. The `generate()` function takes many parameters and has complex internal logic that's difficult to test and extend. Adding new configuration options requires modifying the function signature and internal logic.

Current issues:
- Single large `generate()` function with complex parameters
- Hard to add new configuration options
- Difficult to test different configuration combinations
- No clear way to customize the generation process
- Complex parameter passing between functions

## Proposed Solution

Implement a builder pattern for the site generation process:

- Create a `SiteGenerator` struct with builder methods
- Allow chaining of configuration options
- Provide sensible defaults for all options
- Make the generation process more testable and extensible

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Design the builder interface
- Create `SiteGenerator` struct with configuration fields
- Define builder methods for each configuration option
- Implement `Default` trait for sensible defaults
- Design the final `generate()` method

### Step 2: Implement the builder
- Create `src/generation_builder.rs` with the builder implementation
- Move complex generation logic into the builder
- Implement builder methods for ramdisk, output directory, etc.
- Add validation for configuration options

### Step 3: Update existing code
- Update `main.rs` to use the new builder pattern
- Update `watch.rs` to use the builder
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Add comprehensive tests for the builder

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `SiteGenerator` builder is implemented and working
- [ ] All existing generation functionality works with builder
- [ ] New configuration options can be easily added
- [ ] Builder pattern is used in main.rs and watch.rs
- [ ] Comprehensive tests cover builder functionality

## Affected Components

- `src/generation_builder.rs` - New file with builder implementation
- `src/generate.rs` - Refactor to work with builder
- `src/main.rs` - Update to use builder pattern
- `src/watch.rs` - Update to use builder pattern
- `src/config.rs` - May need updates for builder configuration

## Risks & Considerations

- **Breaking Changes**: Risk of breaking existing functionality
- **Complexity**: Builder pattern may add complexity initially
- **Performance**: Need to ensure no performance regression
- **Testing**: Need comprehensive tests for all builder combinations

## Notes

The builder pattern will make the generation process much more flexible and testable. This is a significant refactoring that will improve the overall architecture of the codebase.
