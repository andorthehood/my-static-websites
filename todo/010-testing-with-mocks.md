# TODO: Testing with Mocks

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¡
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Open

## Problem Description

The current testing approach is limited by the tight coupling between modules. It's difficult to test individual components in isolation because they depend on concrete implementations of other components. This makes testing complex and brittle.

Current issues:
- Hard to test individual components in isolation
- Tests depend on file system and external resources
- Difficult to test error conditions and edge cases
- Tests are slow due to file I/O operations
- Hard to test different implementation scenarios

## Proposed Solution

Implement comprehensive testing with mocks using the trait-based interfaces:

- Create mock implementations of all major traits
- Enable testing of individual components in isolation
- Test error conditions and edge cases easily
- Make tests faster and more reliable
- Test different implementation scenarios

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create mock implementations
- Create mock implementations for all major traits
- Implement `MockTemplateProcessor`, `MockAssetConverter`, etc.
- Add configurable behavior for different test scenarios
- Create test utilities for common mock setups

### Step 2: Update existing tests
- Refactor existing tests to use mocks where appropriate
- Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
- Create integration tests that use real implementations
- Add performance tests for critical paths

### Step 3: Add comprehensive test coverage
- Add tests for all public interfaces
- Test error handling and recovery
- Add property-based tests for complex functions
- Ensure all code paths are tested

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Mock implementations are available for all major traits
- [ ] Individual components can be tested in isolation
- [ ] Error conditions and edge cases are thoroughly tested
- [ ] Tests are fast and reliable
- [ ] Test coverage is comprehensive

## Affected Components

- `src/tests/` - New directory for test utilities and mocks
- `src/tests/mocks.rs` - Mock implementations
- `src/tests/utils.rs` - Test utilities
- All test files - Update to use mocks where appropriate
- CI/CD - Update to run comprehensive test suite

## Risks & Considerations

- **Maintenance**: Mock implementations need to be maintained
- **Complexity**: More complex test setup
- **Coverage**: Need to ensure mocks don't hide real issues
- **Performance**: Test suite may become slower with more tests

## Notes

Comprehensive testing with mocks will make the codebase much more reliable and easier to maintain. This is the final piece that will complete the interface improvements and make the system robust and testable.
