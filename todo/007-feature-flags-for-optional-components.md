# TODO: Feature Flags for Optional Components

**Priority**: ðŸŸ¢
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Created**: 2024-12-19
**Status**: Open

## Problem Description

The current codebase includes all functionality by default, even features that may not be needed in all use cases. This increases the binary size and complexity. Some features like ramdisk support are platform-specific but always compiled in.

Current issues:
- All features are always compiled in
- Platform-specific code is always included
- No way to disable optional features
- Larger binary size than necessary
- Hard to create minimal builds

## Proposed Solution

Implement feature flags to make components optional:

- Add feature flags in `Cargo.toml` for optional components
- Use conditional compilation for platform-specific code
- Allow users to enable only the features they need
- Provide sensible default features

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Define feature flags
- Add feature flags to `Cargo.toml` for optional components
- Define default features that most users will want
- Plan which components should be optional
- Document feature flag usage

### Step 2: Implement conditional compilation
- Add `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` attributes to optional code
- Implement fallback behavior for disabled features
- Add feature-specific error messages
- Ensure graceful degradation when features are disabled

### Step 3: Update build and documentation
- Update build scripts to handle feature flags
- Add documentation for available features
- Update CI/CD to test different feature combinations
- Provide examples of minimal builds

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Feature flags are implemented for optional components
- [ ] Platform-specific code is properly gated
- [ ] Users can create minimal builds with only needed features
- [ ] All feature combinations are tested
- [ ] Documentation explains available features

## Affected Components

- `Cargo.toml` - Add feature flags
- `src/watch.rs` - Add feature flags for ramdisk support
- `src/converters/` - Add feature flags for TypeScript/SCSS support
- `src/minifier/` - Add feature flags for minification
- `src/server/` - Add feature flags for development server
- Build scripts and CI/CD - Update for feature testing

## Risks & Considerations

- **Breaking Changes**: Feature flags may change default behavior
- **Complexity**: More complex build system
- **Testing**: Need to test all feature combinations
- **Documentation**: Need to document all available features

## Notes

Feature flags will make the static site generator more flexible and allow users to create smaller, more focused builds. This is particularly useful for embedded or resource-constrained environments.
