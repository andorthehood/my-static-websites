<pre>Thievery Corporation: Depth of My Soul
    
[Intro]
Am C F E
Am C F E
       
[Verse]
         Am             C
When our world falls to pieces
        F                  E
And the moonlight starts to hide
     Am             C
In a million little splinters
       F             E
In the corners of our mind
 
      Am      C
Where endless colors
         F               E
They are swallowed by the sun
     Am            C
In a trail full of black holes
     F              E
Just before they had become
     
    Am                C
And fountains full of flowers
   F              E
On islands full of tears;
         Am           C
We'll be winners, and fireworks
     F          E
Will explode and disappear
     
[Chorus]
    Am               C
You believe what you see;
        F              E
All the things that you know
     Am  C         F
But, oh, you, don't know
    E           Am    F
The depth of my soul
    E           Am   F E
The depth of my soul
Am      F
Oooh...
    E           Am   F E
The depth of my soul
     
[Verse]
Am               C
Come it's just a game
    F            E
I'm locking every page
  Am       C
I sense us mirrors
         F            E
Where we must turn our fate
     
    Am       C
The sound of 'Hello'
       F           E
Like a light to the black;
        Am      C
Sending us on a spiral
          F       E
Through a world of goodbyes
     
        Am            C
All the truth that we crave
   F              E
Is up for the last parade;
     Am             C
In a circles of our shadows
         F       E
Where we play our charades
     
[Chorus]
    Am               C
You believe what you see;
        F              E
All the things that you know;
     Am  C        F
But, oh, you don't know
    E           Am    F
The depth of my soul
    E           Am   F E
The depth of my soul
Am      F
Oooh...
    E           Am   F E
The depth of my soul
     
Am      F
Oooh...
    E           Am   F E
The depth of my soul</pre>
