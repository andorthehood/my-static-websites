<p>Hi! I'm Andor Polg√°r, welcome to my corner of the internet. It's part scrapbook, part sandbox, filled with artsy
    experiments, random snapshots, and whatever else I felt like uploading.</p>
<p>This website is meant to simulate a web browser and operating system that never actually existed, inspired by the
    aesthetics of Mac OS 9 and Windows 98.</p>
