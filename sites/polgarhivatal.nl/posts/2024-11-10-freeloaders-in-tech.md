One downside of accepting every LinkedIn connection is that lately I've been getting offers to be the "founding engineer" of AI startups. It's always the same story: someone has a vague idea for a ChatGPT-powered app and needs me to build the whole thing. No salary, just equity in a company that doesn't exist. It reminded me of past tech hypes and how the freeloaders never really left, they just rebrand every few years:

2024 - The AI co-founder era

"Hi! I'm working on an AI startup, imagine a personalized mental health companion that blends coaching, therapy, and journaling. I just need a CTO to build the MVP. The equity upside is massive."

2020 - The crypto gold rush

"Hey, I've launched a new token and we're building an NFT marketplace. It's like OpenSea but better. The dev we had disappeared, are you available? I'll airdrop you 10 million SHIBAMOON420 tokens."

2014 - The Facebook killer era

"Bro, I've got an idea for a social network that fixes everything wrong with Facebook. No ads, no algorithm, more privacy, more fun. Just need someone to build the prototype. We'll split everything 50/50."
