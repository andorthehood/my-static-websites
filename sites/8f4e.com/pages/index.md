8f4e is a stack oriented programming language with a visual code editor that I created to perform generative music at algorave events.

Its primary target is the WebAssembly virtual machine, as I wanted an efficient yet portable tool for real time audio signal generation and processing.

Stack oriented programming means that instead of using registers, instructions take their operands from a stack, and push their results back onto the same stack for the next instruction.

I chose this programming paradigm because the WebAssembly virtual machine is itself a stack machine.

Staying native to this execution model avoids costly abstractions and makes it possible to build a simpler and faster compiler.

```
push 2
push 3
; Pushing values 2 and 3 onto the stack.
add
; After executing the add instruction,
; the stack will contain the value 5

push 10
mul
; Now the stack will contain the value 50

push 10
div
; Now 5 again
```

It's also possible to take values from the stack and store them in the memory.

The language utilizes C-style pointer notations.

```
int result

push &result
push 42
store
; The store instruction takes two values:
; a memory address and the value to store.
```

Programs in 8f4e run inside an endless loop. This reflects how real time audio systems operate, where processing consists of continuously reading from and writing to audio buffers.

8f4e removes this control flow boilerplate and allows programs to focus purely on signal generation and transformation.

```
; Assuming word size is 4 bytes
; Memory address of a is 0x1000
```

In 8f4e, variables declared sequentially in the code are allocated in adjacent memory locations.

Runtime memory allocation is not supported, developers must pre-plan their software's memory needs during coding.

```
int a 1
int b 1
; Memory address of b is a + word size
int c 1
; Memory address of c is b + word size
```

The code is organized into modules, each containing variable declarations and a sequence of commands.

The execution order of the code modules is determined by their dependencies. If a module's output is needed as input for others, it is executed first.

```
module foo

int a 10
int b 20
int result

push &result
push a
push b
add
store
moduleEnd
```

It supports real-time manual modification of variable values while the program is running, without needing recompilation.

```
int foo 10
; You can change these values in the editor
; while the program is running.
int bar 20
; The editor will trace them back in the memory
; and update their values without restarting
; or recompiling the program.
```

All variables in 8f4e are inherently public, with no option to modify visibility.

Also, it's not memory safe, pointers can point to anything within the memory space of the program, but the wires help developers to find where their pointers are pointing.

```
int* pointer

push &pointer
push pointer
push WORD_SIZE
push add
store

; pointer will iterate through all
; possible memory addresses.
```
