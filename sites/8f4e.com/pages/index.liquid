<p>8f4e is a stack-oriented programming language with a semi-visual interface that I originally designed to perform generative music on algorave events. It's meant to be an efficient, but at the same time portable tool for real-time audio signal generation and processing. One of its most unique features is its representation of pointers using interconnected wires.</p>
