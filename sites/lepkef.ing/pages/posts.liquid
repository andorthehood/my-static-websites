<p>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andor PolgÃ¡r, and this is my corner of the internet. It's part scrapbook, part sandbox full of artsy experiments, random snapshots, and whatever else I felt like uploading.</p>

<ul>
{% assign filtered = posts | where: "nsfw", nil %}
{% for post in filtered %}
  <li><a href="/posts/{{ post.slug }}">{{ post.title }} {{ post.emojis }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
