<p>This post originally had some explicit photos, but I've moved them to my Flickr account instead. Flickr takes care of country-specific age verification, so you'll need to create an account and confirm your age to view them.</p>

<p>As of now, the legal requirements for age verification vary too much between countries and it's too complicated and I'm too lazy to implement it properly on my website.</p>
